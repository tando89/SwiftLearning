        //binding optional means that we make sure user have something at his point before the program starts the function drive. If it is nothing (nil) it will skips without crashing the app. However if we use ! which means force to unwrap (100 % sure that will be something in the "destination", but if not it will crash the app. So binding optinal is the safer way to unwrap the ? optional.
